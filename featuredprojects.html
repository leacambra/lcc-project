        <div id="featuredCopy"><p>Planning my wedding with my husband was the most fun and exhilarating few months of our lives.  We donâ€™t do things in a basic manner; we had to make sure our wedding showed our unique personalities and passions.  Knowing we wanted to get married on the beach in our hometown in the Hamptons, we decided we wanted a rustic-chic-beach wedding.  I designed our nautical logo; he crafted our wedding arch from pieces of driftwood we collected from local beaches. We designed everything from the centerpieces and table settings to the invitations and favors.  We are a very crafty couple; we even incorporated the hand-made signs Dave used when he proposed to me in Montauk. To keep our guests up to date, we created our own website that you can visit 
            <a href="http://www.leaanddave2016.wixsite.com/wedding">here.</a>   <br/><br/>

The whole event was amazing. We not only planned the esthetics, but each aspect of the execution from the ceremony to the reception at a local waterfront venue.  Everything went wonderfully smooth and it was the most amazing night of our lives.    <br/><br/>
This wonderful experience made we want to get into event planning.  I hope I can inspire and help with your event as well.    <br/><br/>
